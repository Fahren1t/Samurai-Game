# Samurai-Game
this is a unity Game project for mobile. In this game player will have to deal with the enemies that are coming towards to him.
The samurai that is in our controll can not move. it can only atack and deflect. The player will be static and the enemies will be moving.
depending on the enemy, the player will have to deflect, atack or both in an order which is determined by the kind of enemy in order to defeat the enemy that is coming towards the player.
The player will be standin at the left side of the screen, and the enemies will coming towards from the right side of the screen. These are the main mechanics, further mechanics is not guarrantied to be added.

**A) Write a small pet project to get into coding again. The code in GitHub can be relatively simple (e.g., a game with console output). The doc can be short! (in contrast to the one below)**

**B**) Make sure each person has applied the following topics on the code which have been taught in the lecture:

1. Use and understand **GIT!** Be able to apply the basic commands. Can you experiment with time travelling or branches/merges?!
2. **UML:** at least **3** good different diagrams. "good" means you can pump it up artificially as written in DDD. You have 10 million $ from me! Please export the pics. I can not install all the tools to view them! For example, these diagrams are a good idea: Use-Case, Component D, Class D, and activity Diagram.
3. **REQUIREMENTS**: Crfeate 5-10 good requirements for your project. Then put them into a simple tool (like Airtable, Notion or Trello) and in a professional tool (like Monday, Jira, Doors, ObjectIF, Xebrio, etc.) Instead of the professional version, you can also build a tool yourself; e.g. with AI! If you have used AI / LLMs here, briefly describe where and how! However, it is more important here that really some / many attributes are used!
4. **Analysis**:
5. A) **DDD**: Do an Event-Storming to find your Domains! If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 100 Mio € from Edlich-Investment!) **(B)** Develop a clear strategic design with mappings/relationships with >4 Domains coming from an Event Storming **(A)**. Drop your Domains into a Core Domain Chart **(C)** and indicate the Relations = Mappings (! see MIRO examples again) between the Domains!
6. **METRICS:**at least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non-trivial metrics are also fine.
7. **Clean Code Development:** A) At least 5 points you can show me with an explanation of why this is clean code in your code and/or what has improved & B) >>10 points on your personal CCD cheat sheet. E.g. a PDF.
8. **BUILD** Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc. (it could be also disconnected from the project just to learn a build tool!) => to be merged with 7!
9. **Continuous Delivery:** show me your pipeline using e.g. **Jenkins**, Travis-CI, Circle-CI, GitHub Action, GitLab CI, etc. E.g. you can also use Jenkins Pipelining or BlueOcean, etc. But at least insert more than 2 script calls as done in the lecture! (e.g. also call Ant or Gradle or something else).
10. Integrate some nice **unit tests** in your Code to be integrated into the Build
11. Use a good **IDE** and get fluent with it: e.g. VSCode, IntelliJ. What are your favourite key shortcuts?!
12. **DSL** Create a small DSL Demo example snippet in your code even if it does not contribute to your project (hence it can also be in another language).
13. **Functional Programming:** prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as:
    - only final data structures
    - (mostly) side-effect-free functions
    - the use of higher-order functions
    - functions as parameters and return values
    - use closures / anonymous functions
    - You can also do it outside of your project. Even in other languages such as F#, Clojure, Julia, etc.
14. **BONUS** Task: Can you set up a runnig **AI Coding** environment?
